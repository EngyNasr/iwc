# Nanopore _Allele-based Pathogen Identification_

Another approach to identifying pathogens is to use an allelic approach by detecting SNPs, i.e. markers showing evolutionary histories of homogeneous strains. This process includes SNP calling, aimed at identifying novel pathogen strains and elucidating discrepancies compared to reference sequences, thereby facilitating the tracking of emerging variants. Within this workflow, both variants and SNPs are discerned, serving as crucial elements for subsequent pathogen identification and variant tracking purposes.
