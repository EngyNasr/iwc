# Pathogen Tracking among all samples

In this workflow, we will aggregate results and use the results from **Gene based pathogenic identification** workflow to help tracking pathogenes among samples by:

1. Drawing a presence-absence heatmap of the identified VF genes within all samples to visualize in which samples these genes can be found.
2. Drawing a phylogenetic tree for each pathogenic gene detected, where we will relate the contigs of the samples together where this gene is found.

With these two types of visualizations we can have an overview of all samples and the genes, but also how samples are related to each other, which common pathogenic genes they share. Given the time of the sampling and the location one can easily identify using these graphs, where and when the contamination has occurred among the different samples.
